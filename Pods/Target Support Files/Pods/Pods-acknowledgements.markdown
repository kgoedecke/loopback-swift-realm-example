production and commercial purposes so long as Customer is using the Software to

      encourage others to do so, except to the limited extent, if any, that
      applicable law permits such acts notwithstanding any contractual
      prohibitions, provided, however, before Customer exercises any rights that
      Customer believes to be entitled to based on mandatory law, Customer shall
      provide StrongLoop with thirty (30) days prior written notice and provide

      of this Agreement, provided further that Customer shall be liable for any
      failure by such employees and third-party contractors to comply with the
      terms of this Agreement and no usage restrictions, if any, shall be
      exceeded; or
      1.3.4 create, develop, license, install, use, or deploy any third party
      software or services to circumvent or provide access, permissions or
      rights which violate the license keys embedded within the Software; or

secrets, (ii) existing or contemplated Software, services, designs, technology,
processes, technical data, engineering, techniques, methodologies and concepts

five (5) years from the date of disclosure of the applicable Confidential
Information, Customer shall (i) hold the Confidential Information in trust and
confidence and avoid the disclosure or release thereof to any other person or

disclosure, or dissemination of its own Confidential Information of a similar
nature, but not less than reasonable care, and (ii) not use the Confidential
Information for any purpose whatsoever except as expressly contemplated under
this Agreement; provided that, to the extent the Confidential Information
constitutes a trade secret under law, Customer agrees to protect such
information for so long as it qualifies as a trade secret under applicable law.
Customer shall disclose the Confidential Information only to those of its
employees and contractors having a need to know such Confidential Information
and shall take all reasonable precautions to ensure that such employees and
contractors comply with the provisions of this Section.  The obligations of
Customer under this Section shall not apply to information that Customer can
demonstrate (i) was in its possession at the time of disclosure and without
restriction as to confidentiality, (ii) at the time of disclosure is generally
available to the public or after disclosure becomes generally available to the
public through no breach of agreement or other wrongful act by Customer, (iii)
has been received from a third party without restriction on disclosure and
without breach of agreement by Customer, or (iv) is independently developed by
Customer without regard to the Confidential Information.  In addition, Customer
may disclose Confidential Information as required to comply with binding orders
of governmental entities that have jurisdiction over it; provided that Customer
gives StrongLoop reasonable written notice to allow StrongLoop to seek a
protective order or other appropriate remedy, discloses only such Confidential
Information as is required by the governmental entity, and uses commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any Confidential
Information disclosed.  Notwithstanding the above, Customer agrees that
StrongLoop, its employees and agents shall be free to use and employ their
general skills, know-how, and expertise, and to use, disclose, and employ any
generalized ideas, concepts, know-how, methods, techniques or skills gained or
learned during the Term or thereafter.

      parties.  This allocation is an essential element of the basis of the
      bargain between the parties.
7. Term and Termination.
7.1 This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for so long
as Customer has a valid Subscription and is current on the payment of any
Subscription Fees required to be paid for that Subscription (the "Subscription
Term").  Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written
notice to the other party, and the Subscription and licenses granted hereunder
automatically terminate upon the termination of this Agreement.  This Agreement
will terminate immediately without notice from StrongLoop if Customer fails to
comply with or otherwise breaches any provision of this Agreement.

custom and similar fees levied upon the delivery or use of the Software and the
Subscriptions described in this Agreement.  Fees shall be invoiced in full upon
StrongLoop's acceptance of Customer's purchase order for the Subscription.  All
invoices shall be paid in US dollars and are due upon receipt and shall be paid
within thirty (30) days. Payments shall be made without right of set-off or
chargeback. If Customer does not pay the invoices when due, StrongLoop may

law, whichever is lower, on the unpaid balance from the original due date. If
Customer fails to pay fees in accordance with this Section, StrongLoop may
suspend fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement (including but not
limited to suspending the services under the Subscription) until payment is
received by StrongLoop.  If any applicable law requires Customer to withhold
amounts from any payments to StrongLoop under this Agreement, (a) Customer shall
effect such withholding, remit such amounts to the appropriate taxing
authorities and promptly furnish StrongLoop with tax receipts evidencing the
payments of such amounts and (b) the sum payable by Customer upon which the
deduction or withholding is based shall be increased to the extent necessary to
ensure that, after such deduction or withholding, StrongLoop receives and
retains, free from liability for such deduction or withholding, a net amount
equal to the amount StrongLoop would have received and retained absent the
required deduction or withholding.

9.1 Compliance with Laws.  Customer shall abide by all local, state, federal and
international laws, rules, regulations and orders applying to Customer's use of
the Software, including, without limitation, the laws and regulations of the

and technical data of United States origin, including the Software.  Customer
agrees that it will not export or re-export the Software without the appropriate
United States or foreign government licenses.
9.2 Entire Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties concerning the subject matter hereof.  This Agreement supersedes all
prior or contemporaneous discussions, proposals and agreements between the
parties relating to the subject matter hereof.  No amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing
and signed by both parties.  Any additional or different terms on any purchase
orders issued by Customer to StrongLoop shall not be binding on either party,
are hereby rejected by StrongLoop and void.

unenforceable, the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect and
such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible so as to effect
the intent of the parties and shall be reformed to the extent necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable.
9.4 Waiver.  No waiver of rights by either party may be implied from any actions
or failures to enforce rights under this Agreement.
9.5 Force Majeure.  Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or
failure to perform due to causes beyond its reasonable control (excluding
payment of monies due).
9.6 No Third Party Beneficiaries.  Unless otherwise specifically stated, the
terms of this Agreement are intended to be and are solely for the benefit of
StrongLoop and Customer and do not create any right in favor of any third party.

laws of the State of California, without reference to the principles of
conflicts of law.  The provisions of the Uniform Computerized Information

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
